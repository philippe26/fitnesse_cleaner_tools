# MHTML Cleaner

Two scripts for converting MHTML files to standalone HTML and validating the output.

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mhtml-cleaner.py` | Converts an MHTML file to a self-contained HTML file |
| `test-html-validator.py` | Validates an HTML file produced by the cleaner |

---

# mhtml-cleaner.py

Converts an MHTML file into a standalone HTML file that displays correctly in a browser without a local server.

## Features

- **MHTML → HTML conversion**: extracts the HTML section and removes the multipart structure
- **Automatic CSS injection**: extracts embedded stylesheets from the MHTML and injects them into a `<style>` tag
- **Localhost link replacement**: converts `http://localhost:<port>/...` links into local anchors or removes them
- **Base64 image injection**: extracts embedded images and inlines them directly into the HTML
- **Automatic port detection**: dynamically identifies the port used in the MHTML file
- **Artifact database**: builds a cross-reference index of all artifact definitions (`Doc.Type.Object`)
- **Hover tooltips** _(optional)_: shows the full artifact definition when hovering over a link
- **Optional button removal**: strips editing buttons from the original interface
- **Optional sidebar removal**: strips the side navigation panel
- **HTML validation** _(optional)_: runs `test-html-validator.py` automatically on the output

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+

## Cleaning levels

### `--level light`

Replaces only links pointing to the main page with local anchors.

```
href="http://localhost:<port>/Doc.DocName#7"  →  href="#7"
```

### `--level moderate` (default)

In addition to `light`:
- Disables links to inaccessible resources (`/files/fitnesse/`, `/FrontPage`, etc.) → `#`
- Disables links to other pages → `#`

### `--level strict`

Same as `moderate`, but actively removes non-functional links instead of replacing them with `#`.

---

## Examples

### Standard conversion
```bash
python3 mhtml-cleaner.py input.mhtml
```

### Full cleanup: buttons, sidebar, hover tooltips, validation
```bash
python3 mhtml-cleaner.py input.mhtml -A
```

### Export artifact database
```bash
python3 mhtml-cleaner.py input.mhtml --database-file artifacts
# → writes artifacts.csv
```

### Hover tooltips only
```bash
python3 mhtml-cleaner.py input.mhtml -H
```

### Validate output without cleaning options
```bash
python3 mhtml-cleaner.py input.mhtml -V
```

---

## URL resolution logic

All localhost URLs follow the pattern:

```
http://localhost:<port>/<doc_prefix>.<doc_name>[?options][#fragment]
```

After quoted-printable decoding, the script applies these decision rules to every `href` and `src` attribute:

### Rule 1 — System resource → removed
URLs pointing to FitNesse system resources (`/files/fitnesse/`, `/FrontPage`, `/RecentChanges`, etc.) are stripped entirely.

### Rule 2 — Fragment present → local anchor
Any URL containing `#fragment` is converted to that anchor, regardless of the page it points to.

```
href="http://localhost:50020/Doc.DocName?flatPage#7"  →  href="#7"
href="http://localhost:50020/Doc.DocName#42"          →  href="#42"
```

### Rule 3 — Doc-level URL (2 dot-parts) → neutral anchor
URLs with exactly 2 dot-separated path parts (`Doc.DocName`) with no fragment become `#`.

```
href="http://localhost:50020/Doc.DocName?edit"  →  href="#"
```

### Rule 4 — Artifact URL (3+ dot-parts) → named anchor + database entry
URLs with 3 or more dot-separated parts (`Doc.Type.ObjectId`) point to a specific artifact. The query string is stripped and the path becomes the anchor. The object is recorded in the artifact database.

```
href="http://localhost:50020/PidS.DeF.EquipmentPosition"            →  href="#PidS.DeF.EquipmentPosition"
href="http://localhost:50020/PidS.DeF.EquipmentPosition?attributes" →  href="#PidS.DeF.EquipmentPosition"
```

### Special case — Image src
`src` attributes with `?file&name=<img_name>` are **not rewritten**. They are left intact for the base64 injection step.

```
src="http://localhost:50020/PidS.DeF.FrameEth?file&name=frame.png"
  →  src="data:image/png;base64,..."
```

---

## Artifact database

The script scans all `<div id="Doc.Type.Object">` elements and builds an in-memory database. The object id can have multiple dot-separated parts (`MibCont.TreeMain.FeLin` is valid).

Only artifacts whose doc prefix matches the current document are indexed (cross-document references are ignored).

When `--database-file` is specified, the database is exported as a CSV with columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `id` | Full artifact id (`PidS.DeF.EquipmentPosition`) |
| `document` | Doc prefix (`PidS`) |
| `type` | Artifact type (`DeF`) |
| `object` | Object id, may include sub-parts (`EquipmentPosition`) |
| `description` | Short description extracted from the `<b>` title |

---

## Hover tooltips (`--include-hovering` / `-H`)

When active, hovering over any `<a href="#Doc.Type.Object">` displays a floating panel with the full content of the target `<div>`. The panel is limited to 30% of the screen height; a `▼ truncated` indicator appears if the content is clipped.

The native browser `title=` tooltip is suppressed when this option is active (both would show simultaneously otherwise). Without `-H`, the short description remains visible as a standard `title=` attribute.

---

## Review annotation system (`--include-review` / `-R`)

When active, right-clicking any artifact div (elements with a non-empty `artifact-type` attribute) opens a context menu:

- **Add Major** — a blocking / critical issue
- **Add Minor** — a non-blocking issue
- **Add Comment** — a general remark

Clicking a menu item opens a single-line text prompt (`OK` / `Cancel`). On OK, the review is saved to the browser's `localStorage` with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `user` | Reviewer login (set once via _Set user name…_ in the menu) |
| `artifact` | Full artifact id (`PidS.DeF.EquipmentPosition`) |
| `context` | `Major`, `Minor`, or `Comment` |
| `text` | Free-form annotation text |
| `date` | Timestamp at time of entry (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`) |

Reviews are loaded automatically every time the page opens and displayed inline, just below the corresponding artifact div, as `<div class="review">` blocks. Each entry shows a coloured badge (red = Major, orange = Minor, blue = Comment), the author and date, and the text.

The user name is set via **Set user name…** (bottom of the menu) and persists across sessions. It can be changed at any time via **Change user (…)**.

Review data is scoped to the document title, so multiple documents opened in the same browser do not interfere with each other.

> **Note:** reviews are stored in `localStorage` — they are local to the browser and are not written back to the HTML file. To share reviews, export `localStorage` manually or use the browser's developer tools.

## Processing pipeline

1. Read MHTML file and detect port
2. Extract HTML section + decode quoted-printable encoding
3. Clean malformed HTML tags
4. Replace localhost links (according to chosen level)
5. Inject embedded CSS into a `<style>` tag
6. Extract and inject images as base64
7. Clean data URLs in CSS
8. Build artifact database
9. Add hover tooltips _(if `-H`)_ or native `title=` attributes
10. Remove buttons _(if `-b` or `-A`)_
11. Remove sidebar _(if `-s` or `-A`)_
12. Inject hover JS+CSS _(if `-H`)_
13. Inject review annotation system _(if `-R`)_
14. Remove `cid:` references (MHTML-specific)
15. Save as plain HTML
16. Run validator _(if `-V`)_

---

## Output

The generated HTML file is **100% self-contained**:
- Works offline, no server required
- Opens in Edge, Chrome, and Firefox
- CSS and images embedded inline
- Internal navigation via anchors

---

## Troubleshooting

### Page displays without styles
The CSS was not injected. Use `-v` to check that CSS sections are detected in the MHTML.

### Anchors do not work
Links that referenced other pages are replaced with `#` — this is expected.

### Main page not detected correctly
Use `-v` to check the `Main page` line. The script tries three detection methods in sequence: MHTML header, most frequent URLs, HTML title tag.

---

## Use as a Python module

```python
from mhtml_cleaner import MHTMLCleaner

cleaner = MHTMLCleaner(
    input_file='input.mhtml',
    output_file='output.html',
    level='moderate',
    remove_buttons=True,
    remove_sidenav=True,
    include_hovering=True,
    verbose=True
)
success = cleaner.clean()
```
